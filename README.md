# Metis Project 2 - Predicting FIFA Players Market Value with Regression

### Introduction:
In the second and third week of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp, every participant embark on his personal regression machine learning project. In my project, I webscraped around 20,000 footballers' data from Fifa Index and attempt to use their personal metrics and skills ratings to predict their market value.

Through this project, I employ skills such as feature selection and engineering, regularization and cross-validation with several models such as LASSO regression, Ridge regression, Elastic Net regression, and Polynomial regression. I also picked up important skills such as interpreting the OLS summary table, and understanding the QQ-plot.
